Hey there! itâ€™s good to know that you are interested in knowing the proper way of defining a function in Python rather than just opting the hit and trial method like some of the people out there.

Listed below is a set of simple rules to define a function in Python:

def keyword is used to start the Function Definition.
def keyword is followed by function-name which is followed by parenthesis which contains the arguments passed by the user (if any).
Colon is used at the end of the function name to indicate the start of function body from the next line.
After adding the colon, start the body of the function with an indented block in the new line.
The return statement sends a result object back to the caller. A return statement with no argument is equivalent to return none.
